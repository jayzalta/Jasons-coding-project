        <p id="lonzoba">Lonzo Ball is the oldest of the Ball brothers and right now is a freshman point guard for the UCLA Bruins basketball team.</p>
        <p id="lonzobal">Lonzo is projected to be the first overall pick in this year's draft and he wants to be like Russell Westbrook because he also went to UCLA.</p>
        <p>He is 19 years old and is a 6'6" point guard and almost has a 40-inch vertical leap. </p>
        <p>His shooting form may look a little weird but he's been practicing his shooting more than anyone in this year's draft class and he can score from almost anywhere.</p>
        <p>This season at UCLA, he is averaging 14.7 PPG, 7.6 APG, and 6.1 RPG.</p>
