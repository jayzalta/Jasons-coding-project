        <p>The Ball brothers are basketball players from Chino Hills, California, who last year, went 35-0 and won the state championship with all three brothers starring.</p>
        <p>They shocked the basketball world and showed what the future of basketball may look like with their fast pace of play.</p>
        <p>Their childhood was mostly spent practicing basketball and all of that really paid off as their shooting is very good and they even took shots from way beyond the 3-point line.`</p>
        <p>Even though Lonzo is already on UCLA, LaMelo and LiAngelo are both commited to UCLA.</p>
